# Key UX Decisions

## Decision 1: Recommendation Before Browsing
Users receive guidance before viewing profiles.
This reduces confusion and wrong engagement choices.

## Decision 2: City-First Flow
City selection happens early.
This builds trust and improves feasibility for hardware execution.

## Decision 3: Cost & Timeline as Ranges
Ranges are shown instead of exact values.
This sets realistic expectations without false precision.
